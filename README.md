# mybots

The Project in this repository expands upon the guidance found in the ludobots reddit course. This also utilisez pyrosim (Python Robot Simulation). This specific version uses bodies, sensors, motors, and synapses to design random bodies in a 3D space. The code builds off of a previous assignemtn to build a snake and literally branches off from this body to construct a random creature in the morphospace.
